# HotelReview_LatentAspectAnalysis
• To improve the customers’ experience of using online hotel recommendation system by developing a latent aspect rating analysis algorithm based on reviews.<br/>
• In our designed system, users could input any keywords they are interested in and their preferred weights on tags. Our system will generate a hotel recommendation map, which may help them find the best hotel according to their personalized need.<br/>
• Transfer the reviews into normalized feature matrices and a normalized rate vector with Pandas& NumPy.<br/>
• Apply Bayesian Model to hotel rates and do mathematic calculation. Specifically, apply and run VI<br/>
algorithm in MATLAB. Getting aspect rates, analyze and visualize results in Python (matplotlib).<br/>

# The Designed Bayesian Model
